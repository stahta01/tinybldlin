Tiny Pic bootloader for GNU/Linux (tinybldLin) is a GNU/Linux port for the tinybldWin. TinybldLin has been writted in python using python-serial module and wxphython; it can be run on any linux distro (and maybe mac) who has installed those dependencies. This port pretend to be more than a clone of the original tinybldWin.exe it pretends, in the future, add new futures and enhaces the original ones
